  <h3>About</h3>
  Hi! I am Jason Truluck, a developer, tinkerer, and overall geek. 
  <br/><br/>

  This blog will chronical my travels through development, projects and pretty
  much any thought I find useful to share or keep. 
  <br/><br/>

  As a developer I primarily work with Ruby on Rails, but also use several other
  languages and technologies including: PHP, Python, Java, SASS, PostgreSQL,
  bash, in no particular order.
  <br/><br/>

  I also enjoy working on several other things including projects with the arduino and
  raspberry pi, home automation, and installing computers in cars :). 
  <br/><br/>

  Also, I love to get out on the trail and mountain bike, playing video games, and watching movies.
